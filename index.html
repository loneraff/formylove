    <i>Hi love, I know it's too late to give you this. 
    I just want to express my gratitude for having you in my life. 
    I know It's been a couple of months since we met, 
    and that's why I'm always looking forward to it.
    Your presence is like a well crafted fuction 
    that brings clarity and purpose into my life. 
    Each smile smile that you wear is a return statement 
    that brightens even the darkest of days, 
    you're much like a loop that I never wanted to break from.
    As we continue scripting the story of 'us', 
    let it be an unending loop of joy, support, and
    unwavearing commitment. With each passing day, 
    my affection for you grows exponetially, 
    defying the conventional rules of emotional arithmetic. 
    You are not just a variable in the equation of my life; 
    you are the constant that makes everything worthwhile.
    So here's  to our unique program, 
    running smoothly with the each shared moment.
    I miss you so much my compiler</i>
